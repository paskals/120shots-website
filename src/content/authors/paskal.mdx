## About me

I’m from Bulgaria, I live in the Netherlands, but I also travel often to Taiwan. I’m an engineer at heart, but I’ve been interested in photography my whole life. I started with a DSLR after I got my first job. I’ve been shooting mostly landscape and street photography for more than 10 years. I started shooting film a few years ago, and ever since then I haven’t looked back. I love shooting film, especially for the type of photography I do. I mostly shoot for fun and I enjoy the process of photography – film lets me take my time and consider every decision carefully.

The name of this blog is “120 Shots”, not because I exclusively shoot 120 film, but just because I believe 120 is the best film format. Medium format in general is great because it can be used in many different types of cameras – from field cameras to SLRs, to rangefinders. 120 in particular is perfect because it’s the perfect length – 12 shots in 6×6 square format. Compared to 135 where you have 24 or 36 shots, with 12 shots you never have to wonder how to “finish” the last few shots of a roll.
