For the first autumn with my Nikon F3 I picked a higher ISO film to be able to have more possibilities in darker conditions. I ended up not really shooting evenings or nights, but the colors I got from Lomography 800 were amazing!

## Walk around the NL-BE-DE tri-point

For a short day trip we went to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany tri-point. It's a nice forest area and it was worth going there for the short hike. It was a bit cloudy, but the 800 ISO helped with getting reasonable exposure times. 

I definitely missed focus on a few shots from this roll, since I was mostly shooting the 50mm F/1.4 Nikkor lens wide open. The greens and reds with Lomography 800 look amazing. The orange shades of fallen leaves seem a bit exaggerated as well.

## Den Bosch

I thought I would be "abusing" the 800 ISO film in the daylight, but I can almost say that I prefer to shoot it during the day! This has become one of my favourite film stocks when colors need some extra "pop".

## Brussels

We visited Brussels for a (sunny) day. It's an amazing city with lots of street photography inspiration for me. Belgium in general looks quite different to the Netherlands  so it's always nice to visit and photograph.

## Eindhoven

To finish off the roll, we went for a walk in one of Eindhoven's biggest parks. It looks beautiful during the autumn, and even better on Lomo 800. These shots really made me want to choose Lomo 800 for any colorful scene, but especially autumns.

The orange leaves look almost red, and the halations around bright spots also add to the autumn color palette.

I really like the second-last shot of the couple hugging with all the leaves on the ground. It was quite spontaneous, but it worked out well.
